The image is a table that presents data related to various objectives and their respective results or outcomes. Here is a detailed description of the table:

### Table Description

**Table Title:** KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

**Columns:**
1. **Objective/Project:** This column lists different objectives or projects for which performance metrics are being measured.
   - The objectives listed in this column include:
     - Riduzione makespan medio (Average Cycle Time Reduction)
     - Aumento utilizzo macchine (Increase in Machine Utilization)
     - Diminuzione cambi formato (Reduction of Format Changes)
     - Riduzione varianza lead time (Reduction of Lead Time Variance)

2. **Result/Outcome:** This column shows the actual results or outcomes achieved for each objective.
   - The results listed are:
     - Riduzione makespan medio (-15,1%)
     - Aumento utilizzo macchine (+0,1%)
     - Diminuzione cambi formato (-23,1%)
     - Riduzione varianza lead time (+10,7%)

**Additional Information:**
- The table also includes a column titled "Riduzione makespan medio," which seems to be the same as the objective/project listed in the first column. This might indicate that this is the primary focus or goal of the project.
- There are two additional columns:
  - **Obiettivo Progetto:** This column lists the objectives for each project, corresponding to the objectives listed in the "Objective/Project" column.
  - **Raggiunto Raggiunto:** This column indicates whether the objective was achieved or not, with values ranging from 0% to 100%.

### Analysis and Description

The table provides a clear comparison of the performance metrics for different objectives within a project. Here is an analysis based on the data presented:

- **Objective/Project:** Riduzione makespan medio (Average Cycle Time Reduction)
  - **Result:** -15,1% reduction in average cycle time. This indicates that the project successfully reduced the average time taken to complete a task or process within the organization.

- **Objective/Project:** Aumento utilizzo macchine (Increase in Machine Utilization)
  - **Result:** +0,1% increase in machine utilization. This suggests that the project led to an improvement in how efficiently machines were used within the organization.

- **Objective/Project:** Diminuzione cambi formato (Reduction of Format Changes)
  - **Result:** -23,1% reduction in format changes. This indicates a significant decrease in the number of format changes made during the project period, which could imply improved efficiency or standardization within the organization's processes.

- **Objective/Project:** Riduzione varianza lead time (Reduction of Lead Time Variance)
  - **Result:** +10,7% reduction in lead time variance. This shows a substantial improvement in reducing the variability in lead times, which is crucial for maintaining consistent delivery schedules and meeting project deadlines.

### Conclusion

The table effectively summarizes the performance metrics achieved by different objectives within a project. The data indicates that while some objectives were successfully met (e.g., reduction of average cycle time), others fell short, such as the significant reduction in format changes and lead time variance. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement and optimize future projects based on these performance metrics.
