The image displays a table with two columns labeled "Attività" (Activities) and "Costo [€]" (Cost [€]). The table is structured as follows:

| Attività | Costo [€] |
|----------|-----------|
| 1        | 25.000 €   |
| 2        | 20.000 €   |
| 3        | 20.000 €   |

### Detailed Description:

- **Title**: The table does not have a title, but it is labeled "Attività" and "Costo [€]". This suggests that the table is likely part of a report or analysis related to activities and their associated costs.

- **Columns**:
  - **Attività (Activities)**: This column lists different activities. The activities are numbered from 1 to 3, indicating that there might be more than three activities being compared or analyzed.
  - **Costo [€] (Cost [€])**: This column lists the costs associated with each activity. Each cost is given in euros (€).

### Analysis:

From the table, we can observe the following:

1. **Activity 1**: The cost for Activity 1 is €25,000.
2. **Activity 2**: The cost for Activity 2 is €20,000.
3. **Activity 3**: The cost for Activity 3 is also €20,000.

### Interpretation:

From the data presented in this table, we can infer several things:

- **Cost Comparison**: Comparing the costs of Activities 1 and 2, it's clear that Activity 1 has a higher cost than Activity 2 by €5,000. Similarly, comparing Activities 1 and 3, both have the same cost of €20,000.
- **Cost Efficiency**: If we are looking for activities with lower costs, Activities 2 and 3 would be more economical options compared to Activity 1.
- **Potential Areas for Improvement**: The higher cost of Activity 1 might suggest that there could be room for improvement or optimization in the associated processes or resources.

### Conclusion:

The table provides a clear comparison of costs associated with different activities, which can be useful for decision-making and resource allocation purposes. By analyzing these costs, organizations can identify areas where they may need to reduce expenses or invest more resources to achieve better outcomes.
