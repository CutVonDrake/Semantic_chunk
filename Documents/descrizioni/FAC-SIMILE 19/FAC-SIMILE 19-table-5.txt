The image is a table that presents data related to technical objectives and their respective results. Here is a detailed description of the table:

### Table Description

**Table Title:** Obiettivo Tecnico

**Columns:**
1. **Obiettivo Tecnico**: This column lists various technical objectives, which are:
   - Riduzione consumo energetico (Reduction of energy consumption)
   - Riduzione fermi impianto (Reduction of plant shutdowns)
   - Aumento efficienza produttiva (Increase in production efficiency)
   - Reduzione emissioni CO2 (Reduction of CO2 emissions)

**Rows:**
1. **Riduzione consumo energetico**:
   - Target Iniziale: -15%
   - Risultato: -14.6%
   - Scostamento o Raggiunto: -0.4%

2. **Riduzione fermi impianto**:
   - Target Iniziale: -30%
   - Risultato: -28.7%
   - Scostamento o Raggiunto: +10.4%

3. **Aumento efficienza produttiva**:
   - Target Iniziale: +10%
   - Risultato: +10.4%
   - Scostamento o Raggiunto: +0.4%

4. **Reduzione emissioni CO2**:
   - Target Iniziale: -20%
   - Risultato: -19.1%
   - Scostamento o Raggiunto: -0.9%

### Analysis and Description

The table provides a comparative analysis of the results achieved against the initial targets for four different technical objectives: energy consumption reduction, plant shutdowns reduction, production efficiency increase, and CO2 emissions reduction. 

1. **Riduzione consumo energetico**:
   - The target was to reduce energy consumption by 15%. However, the actual result achieved was a decrease of 14.6%, which is a slight improvement but still short of the initial goal. The deviation from the target is -0.4%, indicating that the reduction in energy consumption was less than expected.

2. **Riduzione fermi impianto**:
   - The target was to reduce plant shutdowns by 30%. The actual result achieved was a decrease of 28.7%, which is also below the initial goal. The deviation from the target is +10.4%, indicating that there was an improvement in reducing plant shutdowns, but it was not enough to meet the target.

3. **Aumento efficienza produttiva**:
   - The target was to increase production efficiency by 10%. The actual result achieved was a slight increase of 10.4%, which is very close to the initial goal. The deviation from the target is +0.4%, indicating that there was an improvement in production efficiency, but it did not reach the target.

4. **Reduzione emissioni CO2**:
   - The target was to reduce CO2 emissions by 20%. The actual result achieved was a decrease of 19.1%, which is slightly below the initial goal. The deviation from the target is -0.9%, indicating that there was an improvement in reducing CO2 emissions, but it did not reach the target.

### Conclusion

The table provides insights into the effectiveness of different technical objectives and their respective results against the set targets. While some objectives achieved a slight deviation from the initial goals, others exceeded them, indicating successful implementation or improvement in those areas. The data suggests that there is room for further optimization to meet the full targets for energy consumption reduction, plant shutdowns reduction, production efficiency increase, and CO2 emissions reduction.
