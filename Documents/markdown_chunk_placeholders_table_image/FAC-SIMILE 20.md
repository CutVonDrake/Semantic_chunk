Introduzione

Il  presente  documento  rappresenta  il  deliverable  tecnico  finale  relativo  al  progetto  di ottimizzazione delle attività di dispatching presso gli impianti produttivi dell'azienda [Nome Azienda Tessile], operante nel settore della produzione tessile industriale. Il progetto è stato commissionato con l'obiettivo di analizzare, ridisegnare e ottimizzare il sistema di assegnazione e sequenziamento degli ordini di lavorazione, in modo da migliorare l'efficienza globale del sistema produttivo e ridurre i tempi di attraversamento dei lotti. La crescente domanda di flessibilità produttiva e l'esigenza di mantenere alti livelli di qualità e puntualità  nelle  consegne  hanno  evidenziato  la  necessità  di  un  intervento  strutturato  sul sistema di gestione operativa delle risorse di produzione. In questo contesto, il dispatching -ovvero il processo decisionale che stabilisce quali ordini vanno lavorati, in quale sequenza e su quali macchine -rappresenta un punto critico su cui agire per ottenere benefici concreti in termini di produttività. L'attività è stata svolta da [Nome Società di Consulenza], in qualità di partner consulenziale, con  il  coinvolgimento  diretto  del  team  tecnico  e  produttivo  di  [Nome  Azienda  Tessile]. La metodologia  adottata  ha  previsto  un  approccio  basato  sull'analisi  dei dati  storici,  sulla modellazione dei flussi produttivi e sulla validazione di scenari simulativi, al fine di identificare strategie di dispatching più efficaci e coerenti con i vincoli reali della produzione tessile. Il  documento  fornisce  una  descrizione  dettagliata  del  contesto  iniziale,  degli  obiettivi perseguiti, delle soluzioni sviluppate, dei risultati ottenuti in termini quantitativi e qualitativi, e di un'analisi dei costi sostenuti in relazione ai benefici gene rati. Le sezioni seguenti seguiranno una struttura coerente con gli standard di rendicontazione tecnica e saranno supportate da tabelle, grafici e indicatori di performance  per  facilitare la lettura e la valutazione dell'intervento. Descrizione del Problema e Obiettivi Tecnici

1. Contesto operativo e criticità iniziali

Il  sistema  produttivo  di  [Nome  Azienda  Tessile]  è  organizzato  su  più  linee  di  lavorazione parallele, ognuna delle quali può eseguire operazioni su diversi tipi di tessuti con differenti vincoli tecnologici e produttivi. La sequenza con cui i lotti di produzione vengono assegnati alle macchine influisce significativamente sull'efficienza complessiva del sistema, sui tempi di consegna e sull'utilizzo delle risorse. In assenza di una logica strutturata per il dispatching, l'azienda ha riscontrato negli anni le seguenti criticità:

● Eccessivo accumulo di work-in-progress (WIP) in prossimità di alcune macchine;

● Tempi di setup non ottimizzati, dovuti a passaggi frequenti tra lotti con caratteristiche molto diverse;

● Scarsa  visibilità  sullo  stato  di  avanzamento  degli  ordini  e  bassa  tracciabilità  delle decisioni di assegnazione;

● Utilizzo non bilanciato delle risorse disponibili;

● Difficoltà nel rispondere a variazioni impreviste nella domanda o nella disponibilità di macchinari. 2. Obiettivi tecnici del progetto

Alla luce delle criticità osservate, il progetto ha definito i seguenti obiettivi tecnici principali:

● Sviluppare  un  modello  formalizzato  del sistema  di dispatching esistente,  con l'identificazione dei colli di bottiglia e delle principali fonti di inefficienza;

● Introdurre  una  logica  decisionale  di  assegnazione  degli  ordini  basata  su  algoritmi ottimizzati (priorità dinamiche, regole composite, modelli stocastici);

● Ridurre i tempi medi di attraversamento (makespan) dei lotti;

● Abbattere  il  numero  di  cambi  formato  non  necessari  attraverso  una  strategia  di raggruppamento ottimale;

● Migliorare l'equilibrio del carico di lavoro tra le diverse linee di produzione;

● Abilitare la simulazione di scenari alternativi per supportare la pianificazione a medio termine.

### Chunk 2

3. Mappa sintetica degli obiettivi

[[TABLE-2]] START

The image is a table that outlines various aspects of a business intervention or project. It consists of two columns labeled "Area di intervento" (Area of Intervention) and "Obiettivo Specifico" (Specific Objective). The table also includes three rows, each representing different objectives related to efficiency and productivity.

Here is the detailed breakdown of the table:

| Area di intervento | Obiettivo Specifico | KPI associato |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Efficienza produttiva | Riduzione makespan medio | -15% tempo ciclo per lotto |
| Setup e cambi formato | Minimizzazione dei cambi non ottimizzati | -20% transizioni formato |

### Analysis and Description:

1. **Area di intervento (Area of Intervention):**
   - The first row lists "Efficienza produttiva" as the area of intervention, which translates to "Productivity Efficiency." This suggests that the focus is on improving the efficiency of production processes within a company or organization.

2. **Obiettivo Specifico (Specific Objective):**
   - The second row lists "Riduzione makespan medio" as the specific objective, meaning "Reduction of average lead time." This indicates an aim to decrease the average time it takes for products to move from production to delivery.

3. **KPI associato (Associated KPI):**
   - For the first objective, the associated KPI is "-15% tempo ciclo per lotto," which translates to "-15% cycle time per batch." This means that the goal is to reduce the average time it takes for a batch of products to go through the production process from start to finish.

4. **Area di intervento (Area of Intervention):**
   - The third row lists "Setup e cambi formato" as the area of intervention, which translates to "Setup and Formatting." This suggests that the focus is on improving the setup time and formatting processes within a company or organization.

5. **Obiettivo Specifico (Specific Objective):**
   - The specific objective for this row is "Minimizzazione dei cambi non ottimizzati," meaning "Minimization of unoptimized changes." This indicates an aim to reduce the number of unnecessary changes made during the setup and formatting processes.

6. **KPI associato (Associated KPI):**

Le prossime  sezioni descriveranno l'approccio metodologico adottato e le soluzioni algoritmiche sperimentate per il raggiungimento di tali obiettivi. Approccio Metodologico e Soluzioni Sviluppate

1. Metodologia adottata

Il progetto è stato strutturato secondo una metodologia incrementale, basata sul ciclo 'analisi -modellazione -simulazione -validazione'. In una prima fase è stata effettuata una raccolta dati quantitativa e qualitativa, attraverso l'estrazione di log d i produzione dal MES aziendale, interviste con i responsabili di reparto e osservazioni dirette in linea. Sono stati classificati oltre 1200 lotti produttivi, registrando per ciascuno caratteristiche come tipo di tessuto, lavorazione richiesta, durata stimata, macchinari abilitati, e sequenze effettivamente eseguite. In seguito, è stato realizzato un modello descrittivo del processo di dispatching, implementato in ambiente Python tramite una libreria custom basata su NetworkX e SimPy. Questo modello ha permesso di riprodurre digitalmente il comportamento delle linee, con possibilità di iniettare regole alternative di assegnazione e verificare i risultati tramite simulazione discreta. 2. Regole di dispatching sperimentate

Sono state testate sei regole di dispatching, suddivise tra approcci classici (statici) e avanzati (dinamici). Nello specifico:

● FIFO (First In First Out)

● SPT (Shortest Processing Time)

● LPT (Longest Processing Time)

● COVERT (minimizzazione latenze pesate)

● ATC (Apparent Tardiness Cost)

● RuleMix (approccio composito con ponderazione dinamica su più metriche)

Ogni regola è stata testata su 4 scenari di carico (basso, medio, alto, perturbato) e confrontata con i dati reali di produzione. 3. Soluzioni selezionate e architettura finale

L'analisi  dei  risultati  ha  mostrato  che  l'approccio  RuleMix  ha  garantito,  in  media,  i  migliori risultati in termini di riduzione dei tempi medi e della varianza nei lead time. È stato quindi

definito  un  framework  di  dispatching  dinamico  che,  a  ogni  ciclo  di  decisione,  calcola  un punteggio composito per ogni ordine, sulla base di:

● Urgenza rispetto alla data di consegna;

● Durata prevista della lavorazione;

● Cambi formato richiesti sulla macchina target;

● Priorità commerciale dell'ordine. I punteggi vengono aggiornati ogni 15 minuti e la sequenza ottimale è generata in tempo reale tramite  una  funzione  obiettivo  multicriterio. L'integrazione  con  il  sistema  MES  è  avvenuta attraverso  l'export  automatico  delle  sequenze  in  formato  XML,  con  poss ibilità  di  override manuale da parte dell'operatore. Di seguito si riporta una tabella comparativa delle performance ottenute con le varie regole:

[[TABLE-4]] START

Applicando i valori raccolti:

` ROI = (65.500 - 50.000) / 50.000 = 31% `

Il  tempo  stimato  per  raggiungere  il  break-even  è  pari  a 9,2  mesi ,  tenendo  conto  di  una distribuzione progressiva dei benefici a partire dal terzo mese post-deployment. [[IMAGE-4]] START

The image is a line graph titled "Timeline ROI e Break-even." It plots three different metrics against a timeline labeled "Mese dopo deployment" (Month after deployment). The x-axis represents the months following the deployment, ranging from 1 to 12. The y-axis represents the values in euros, with increments of 5000 euros up to 70000 euros.

There are three distinct lines on the graph:

1. **Benefici Cumulati (€)**: This line is represented by a solid yellow line that starts at zero and increases linearly as time progresses. The slope of this line indicates an exponential growth in the cumulative benefits over time.

2. **Break-even (€ 50,000)**: This line is depicted with a dashed red line. It remains constant at a value of 50,000 euros throughout the timeline. The break-even point is clearly marked by this horizontal line, indicating that no additional costs are incurred beyond this amount to achieve zero net benefit.

3. **Mese Break-even (€ -9)**: This line is represented by a dotted blue line. It starts at 0 and increases linearly as time progresses but with a negative slope, meaning the cumulative benefits decrease over time. The break-even point for this metric is also marked at 50,000 euros, indicating that no additional costs are incurred beyond this amount to achieve zero net benefit.

The graph provides a clear visual representation of how different metrics (Benefici Cumulati and Break-even) evolve over time in relation to the deployment timeline. The cumulative benefits increase exponentially while the break-even point remains constant, indicating that the costs do not exceed the benefits at any point during the deployment period.

### Analysis:

1. **Benefici Cumulati (€)**:
   - Starts at zero.
   - Increases linearly over time.
   - Exponential growth pattern.
   - Indicates a positive trend in cumulative benefits as time progresses.

2. **Break-even (€ 50,000)**:
   - Remains constant at 50,000 euros throughout the timeline.
   - No additional costs are incurred beyond this amount to achieve zero net benefit.
   - Indicates a stable financial condition with no risk of incurring losses.

3. **Mese Break-even (€ -9)**:
   - Starts at 0.
   - Increases linearly over time but with a negative slope.
   - Negative cumulative benefits, indicating that the costs exceed the benefits.
   - Indicates a negative trend in cumulative benefits as time progresses.

### Conclusion:

The graph effectively illustrates how different metrics evolve over time in relation to deployment. The exponential growth of Benefici Cumulati suggests an increasingly favorable situation, while the constant break-even point indicates financial stability and no risk of losses. In contrast, the negative cumulative benefits for Mese Break-even suggest a deteriorating financial position that could lead to losses if not addressed. This visualization is useful for understanding the dynamics of ROI and break-even analysis in deployment scenarios.

L'analisi economica  del  progetto  non  solo  ha confermato  la sostenibilità finanziaria dell'intervento, ma ha anche evidenziato un ampio margine di ritorno nel medio periodo. Il raggiungimento del  break-even  in meno  di  dieci  mesi  rappresenta  un  indicatore  chiave  di successo, soprattutto in un settore manifatturiero come  quello tessile, storicamente caratterizzato da margini operativi compressi e cicli produttivi soggetti a forte stagionalità. Inoltre, l'approccio incrementale e data -driven adottato si è dimostrato efficace nel ridurre il rischio di interruzioni operative, favorendo un processo di adozione graduale ma strutturato. I miglioramenti  rilevati,  sia  a  livello  operativo  che  qualitativo,  hanno  superato  le  aspettative iniziali e offerto uno stimolo per un'estensione futura del modello ad altre aree della supply chain aziendale. In prospettiva, il progetto può essere considerato una best practice di riferimento per interventi futuri orientati alla digitalizzazione, alla riduzione degli sprechi e all'agilità decisionale nella pianificazione. Il framework sviluppato è tecnicamente scalabile, economicamente sostenibile e perfettamente allineato con gli obiettivi strategici di competitività e resilienza a lungo termine dell'azienda.
